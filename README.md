# Project-Code
Weather​(Priority #1) - The feature will work as described in the previous milestone. The goal is to use a weather API to gather information about a certain area and then to display it on a user friendly interface. The information will be used for other features so it should be done before almost all of them. 
Comments​(Priority #3) - This is another feature from the previous milestone. This one is slightly changed as instead of having the comment adding features in the same box as the comments that are being displayed, we moved the comment making page to be its own separate page.  
Diagram​(Priority #2) - This is the same as before as it is the main idea of the webpage. A diagram that shows what to wear for the weather that is occurring. It dresses the man in what would appear to be the most appropriate wear.
Search bar​(Priority #4) - The ability to enter what city you would like to know the weather about and for the web page to refresh with all of that information about that city.
Validity Check in all boxes​(Priority #6) - A new feature that was added, checks to make sure that all boxes are filled in and have valid information in them.
